*Personal project!*

An html email template demonstration project using Intuit assets.

Here are screenshots from EmailOnAcid of full renders of the template for...

## Gmail in Chrome

![Gmail in Chrome](../../src/images/intuit/ChromeGmail.png)

## iPhoneX

![iPhoneX](../../src/images/intuit/iPhoneX.png)

## Outlook 2003

![Outlook 2003](../../src/images/intuit/Outlook2003.jpg)

Don't ask me why EmailOnAcid delivered the Outlook screenshot as a .jpg rather than a .png!

Contact me if you are interested in seeing my HTML for this project.
