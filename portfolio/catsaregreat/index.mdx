Personal project!

An html email template demonstration project using [placekitten](https://placekitten.com) and [Cat Ipsum](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gabrielse/cs400/catIpsum.html), featuring our favorite furry feline <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> assassins</span> friends.

I used EmailOnAcid to test this template across 30 different clients.
