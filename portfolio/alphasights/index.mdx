6-week team-based project to update and increase usability of AlphaSights' client portal

Scheduling Tool
Overview
As part of Startup Institute, I worked in a group of 6 to consult for one of Startup Institute's partner companies. The scope of our project was to evaluate what AlphaSights had in place and to recommend improvements. In particular, our team focused on modernizing the usability and appearance of their pages, building an applet to simplify scheduling meetings and implementing a feature to enable downloads from a database into a presentable format.

My Role
I was the UX designer and product manager for this project. As a UX designer, I identified the use case by means of conversation with AlphaSights, conducted user testing of AlphaSights' present system to identify pain points and develop clearer terminology. In addition, as a UX designer, I a) constructed a flow diagram of the business process of presenting experts to AlphaSights' customers, b) created wireframes for the redesign, and c) executed high-fidelity mockups to demonstrate our proposed ideas. As product manager, I ensured the development team kept our specifications in sight on the tools they built.
